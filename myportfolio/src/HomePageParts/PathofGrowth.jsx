    `My journey as a developer began with a deep curiosity about how websites are built and function. I started with the basics  crafting static pages using HTML and CSS  which fueled my interest in creating interactive web experiences.`,
    `As I progressed, I immersed myself in JavaScript and front-end frameworks like React.js and Vite. These tools helped me bring ideas to life with responsive, modern interfaces. I also explored back-end technologies such as Node.js, Express, and databases like MySQL, MongoDB, and Firebase, allowing me to build full-stack applications from the ground up.`,
    `Through academic projects and personal experiments, Iâ€™ve learned to combine creativity and functionality from designing clean UI layouts with Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap to handling server logic and API integration. Each project I work on helps me grow as a developer and strengthens my problem-solving skills.`,
    `Today, I continue to expand my knowledge by exploring topics like real-time communication, cloud deployment, and system scalability. My goal is to become a well-rounded full-stack developer capable of creating impactful digital solutions that make a difference.`,
